<field name="snippet">if people say we should do something about global warming to combat tornadoes, for instance, no. that's probably the least helpful and most expensive way to do almost no good. bill nye, apparently you're talking complete nonsense, because you were saying exactly the same thing the other night. i'm not sure what you mean by -- we can't stop tornadoes, but we could, for example, pass laws making it difficult or undesirable to build fragile houses in the path of tornadoes.</field>
