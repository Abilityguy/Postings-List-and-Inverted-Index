<field name="snippet">yeah, i think there's a real danger in cheerleading extreme events. but the bbc does take climate change very seriously. i've got a team of weather forecasters who are absolute experts in weather and theirjob is to explain the relationship between weather and climate and i think they do a very good job of giving audiences some context and understanding of the bigger picture.</field>
