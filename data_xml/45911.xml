<field name="snippet">tough approach and want to talk about climate change, you'd be laughed a the. the source gave me that kweet laughing as he said it. of course, you can't come to the white house and meet with steven miller and talk about the climate. you'd just be laughed at and then have your job on the line. fantastic reporting as always, thank you.</field>
