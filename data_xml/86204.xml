<field name="snippet">i have the same conversation about once a day that the fellow had with his daughter, to tell people there's no reason to be afraid when you go in the water of sharks. obviously, that's where sharks live, we like to recreate there. what about the seals, what is happening here? is this a global warming issue because all marine life relates to water temperatures here.</field>
