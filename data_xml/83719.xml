<field name="snippet">between 2010-2018, we've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by about a quarter overall. our renewable energy capacity has quadrupled since 2010, and the proportion of our electricity coming from low carbon resources has increased from 19% to more than half in 2018, a record year for renewables. there's a lot more to do, but i think it's a good record on which to base that future action.</field>
