<field name="snippet">and i'm told the president looked at him and said i just decided to say some things i really believe in. he's a second-term president. he doesn't have to run for re-election. we can talk about these policies. you know, the president didn't do these things. he didn't do women in combat. he didn't lift a finger on climate change. he didn't push hard on immigration. he didn't do gun control in his first term. so he's a second-term president who doesn't have to face the voters and these are things he wants to bring front and center. how much will he follow up? we will see.</field>
