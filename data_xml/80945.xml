<field name="snippet">heather: china, immigration, climate change, do they focus too much on donald trump? they need to focus on their opponent but there are other issues that matter. small business, democrats support small business like the plague and community policing as well. there's a lot of stuff they didn't focus on because it was more about tell us about this mean friend, that was a wasted question and i blame the moderators for that.</field>
