<field name="snippet">might be in for disappointments if they took things said in the campaign seriously. it is not the only one. there's move back on climate change -- the rhetoric of climate change, for example. maybe trade, softens, as well. and i think that that's kind of what happens in presidential transitions. we were long enough to remember bill clinton promised a middle class tax cut and then went away magically. these things happen and i think a fair number of those in the trump world.</field>
