<field name="snippet">askew. i don't think global warming causes it i don't even know -- to me it's hot once in a while. you know why, billy. this is my theory and i'm not trying to anger people. i think it's hot out there because the sun is hot. it's always been hot. it was hot when i was a little kid.</field>
