<field name="snippet">flip-flopped. this is kind of a mitt romney type thing where he flip flopped when he was governor to when he was a presidential candidate on issues like abortion and gay rights. if she's going to be a candidate, isn't she going to have to come to terms with her own record on climate change? you know, i don't think her supporters will care if she flip flopped or was a hypocrite or whatever.</field>
