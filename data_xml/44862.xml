<field name="snippet">you're dismissing actually the majority of republican voters. i agree. that. they do want to see action on climate change. the real partisan divide is the republican politicians who have been paid by fossil fuel industry to absolutely deny what for this country is the single biggest opportunity to generate we wealth in the 21st century. we invented solar in this country. now we're at risk of seeing china be the one to give its people tens of millions of green jobs. both sides have some problems here.</field>
