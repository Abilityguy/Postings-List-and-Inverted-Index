<field name="snippet">certainly you hear what he says about obamacare, you hear what he says about climate change. you hear him back off in some ways about how much he'll unwind nafta. how interesting how quickly he's done that. when you saw the last person do this much of it was ronald reagan, to some extent, but he took much longer in that regard. but i think he's getting a little bit more of a pass.</field>
