<field name="snippet">in south florida, tourism and property tax are the main source of revenue for our communities. but much of that property is at risk. hundreds of billions of dollars of assets are currently exposed to the rising seas. billions more will be threatened in the coming decade. regardless of whether greenhouse gas emissions are lowered. we've put a certain amount of co2 into the atmosphere, that's warmed the oceans and the atmosphere and that's going to persist for the next 25 years or so, maybe longer. we've made a commitment, it's already happening. we have to adapt to that. day to day, there isn't anywhere prettier to live.</field>
