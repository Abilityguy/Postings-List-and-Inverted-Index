<field name="snippet">the deficit gun control, averting climate change, maybe iran's nuclear program. certainly you get a sense it's going to be mainly domestic. certainly if you're looking at the tick box in the first four years, i would say killing bin laden, killing gadhafi, the american help to the arab spring, although it's not without difficulty, pulling troops in iraq and setting a timetable for afghanistan, these have all been a seen that president obama would rather focus on domestic issues rather than foreign issues. i think that's true. and i think you see that when he takes the bully pulpit.</field>
