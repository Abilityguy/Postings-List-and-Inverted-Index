<field name="snippet">150 yea rs 150 years ago, we have seen a one degree increase in temperature. so you increase that baseline by one degree, itjust degree, it just means degree, itjust means we're going to see the warmer years happening more frequently, and less frequent likelihood to see the colder years. and again, if you look at the beast from the east from last year, if we didn't have the influence of climate change, that event could have been actually a lot colder than we could</field>
