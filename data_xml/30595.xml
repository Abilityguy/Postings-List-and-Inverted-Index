<field name="snippet">i think there were missed opportunities to talk about things like puerto rico, the earthquakes happening in puerto rico in the context of climate change, to talk about immigration, which now would be a very interesting conversation to have among this new cohort. so i hope moving forward, especially when you look at nevada, california, texas.</field>
