<field name="snippet">i'm very progressive and care deeply about climate change, but if we had a democratic president who tried to use this authority, i would oppose it. it's blatantly unconstitutional what this president is doing. anyone who cares about the constitution should oppose it. you know who's opposing it is actually the military.</field>
