<field name="snippet">thank you both. coming up, an amazing video of a u.s. congressman doing an impersonation of arnold schwarzenegger and denying global warming because it's a huge liberal conspiracy to take control of everyone and everything. it's completely hilarious except that it's basically everything that's wrong with our politics. stay tuned.</field>
