<field name="snippet">it strikes me that fuel efficiencies are a win-win. consumers pay less money for gas. the hair is cleaner and healthier. bigger carbon reductions in terms of climate change. what's not to like? it also creates additional jobs. and you have lots of people working in the clean energy industry. this is where the world is heading. coal is not coming back. really fuel inefficient cars are not coming back. when consumers are not even demanding it is taking us a step backwards.</field>
