<field name="snippet">regarding the question as to climate change, i think the president was fairly straightforward, we're not spending money on that anymore. we consider that to be a waste of your noun do that. meals on wheels sounds great. that's a state decision to fund that particular portion, but to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, look, we want to give you money for programs that don't work. i can't defend that.</field>
