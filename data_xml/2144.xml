<field name="snippet">strategy review that the president gave at the end of the year. no mention of climate change as a national security threat and no mention of american human rights and values. for me the single biggest change with the president, we are not seeing america leading the world through principle. america hasn't always got it right but has some sort of principle and high-moral standing.</field>
